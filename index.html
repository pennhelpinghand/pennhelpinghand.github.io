              Strengthening support networks for people with substance abuse
              disorders.
            </h3>
            <p>
              HelpingHand was a healthtech platform we created for people with
              substance abuse disorders to easily receive support from their
              loved ones. We created a FitBit app with a heart rate monitor to
              detect signs of substance abuse withdrawals or relapse. The
              accompanying app keeps track of healthy habits. <br /><br />Loved
              ones receive a SMS notification when biosignals signal a potential
              withdrawal or relapse while reminding them to celebrate recovery
              milestones. <br /><br />
              Together, Helpinghand complements the substance abuser's existing
              support network, strengthening it. Allowing them a stronger source
              of accountability and positive reinforcement.
              <br />
              <br />
              This was our project for PennApps XX @ the University of
              Pennsylvania where HelpingHand was ranked
              <strong>top 30 out of almost 300 teams.</strong>
